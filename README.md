## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores the **social and psychological determinants of happiness** among adults in **Sylhet Sadar Upazila, Bangladesh**. Using the **Oxford Happiness Questionnaire (OHQ)** and a representative sample collected through **Multistage Cluster Sampling**, we applied **Binary Logistic Regression** to identify key factors influencing happiness.  

The study highlights how **family support, emotional well-being, religion, and governance satisfaction** affect happiness more strongly than income or demographic factors.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Assess the **happiness status** of individuals using the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire.  
- Identify **determinants of happiness** (family, health, socio-demographic, governance, religion).  
- Develop and interpret a **Binary Logistic Regression model**.  
- Provide **policy recommendations** for improving well-being.

## 🗂️ Methodology
- **Sampling**: Multistage Cluster Sampling (Unions → Villages → Participants)  
- **Data Collection**: Structured questionnaire (adapted OHQ, 8 items)  
- **Analysis Tools**:  
  - 📊 **Excel** – descriptive statistics  
  - 📈 **SPSS** – regression analysis, significance testing  
  - 📉 **R** – model validation, ROC curve, visualization

## 📊 Key Findings
- ✅ **Family role satisfaction, emotional support, and affection** were the strongest predictors of happiness.  
- ✅ **Health status** showed a positive but not always significant effect.
